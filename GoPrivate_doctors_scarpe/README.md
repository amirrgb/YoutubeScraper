This web scraping project uses the Scrapy framework to extract contact details of doctors from goprivate.com
The project starts by scraping all specially-scraped pages and then collects information from each individual doctor.
It checks two pages for each doctor: the profile page containing their professional information such as name, specialty, address, and contact page that contains their direct contact details such as email, phone number, and website.
All scraped data is then saved in a CSV file that can be used for various purposes like customer relationship management purposes.
